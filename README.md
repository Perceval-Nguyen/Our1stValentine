# Our1stValentine
Ilymtybltt

To whoever find this note,

This project was create on Feb 01, 2026 during my moving to a new shared room home.

Although I cannot meet my love one this Valentine 2026 in person, but I figure this might be a way to remind her that I am always there for her.

The project took me a couple of months to do during my spare time. I have tried my best although I know to many of you this is not perfect.

My biggest hope is that my love will like this as I am planning to send her this on the exact midnight starting of Feb 14, 2026.

Wish me luck!!!

Also, my best wishes to you and your love ones.

Warmest regards,
Phong
